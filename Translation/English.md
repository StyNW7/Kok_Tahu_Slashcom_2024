## Overview

### Website Name
Kok Tahu?

### Mascot Name
ToFu

### Explanation
We propose a website with games accompanied by learning modules, called Kok Tahu? Students can play various games such as quizzes, musical instrument simulations, and more. If user successfully reaches a level in the game, they will receive badges that can be downloaded. However, if user fails, they can review the material through the provided modules. The creation of a website with educational games will help integrate technology into learning, making students more prepared to face the modern world.

## Hackathon Idea

### Topic / Subtheme
Integration of sub-theme 1 "Inclusive Education" and sub-theme 2 "Creative Learning Media"

### Programming Languages Used in Web Development
The web languages we used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with jQuery as a library for JavaScript. We also used the Bootstrap framework for some specific pages on our website to expedite development given the limited time. Additionally, we utilized several other external plugins. However, in general, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### User Flow of the Website
The user flow of our application is as follows: the user's first view is the Home/Landing Page, where there is a brief explanation of the website, options for provided modules, game sections, testimonials, sponsors, and a footer. Our main features are the modules, game section, quizzes, and tests related to various subjects available, so users from the home page can choose various menus provided to start learning through what we have provided on our platform. If a user cannot perform well in the games, modules are also provided for users to understand the material first. Thus, we hope that our platform can help users learn in an engaging and beneficial way.

### Background of the Problem
Student interest is one of the crucial factors for the success of the learning process. Lack of student interest can make them less focused on learning. Boredom in learning can be indicated by students not paying attention to the teacher, sleeping during class, and skipping classes. 93.2% of students experience boredom due to the numerous activities in school for 8 hours a day because the teaching methods are not varied, causing students to feel bored, tired, and sleepy during the learning process. There are several problems that lead to student boredom. First, lack of student involvement in learning. Usually, learning is one-way and does not actively involve students. Second, abstract concepts in some subjects are often difficult to understand with text and verbal explanations. Third, there are differences in learning styles among students so that a learning technique will not be suitable for all students.

### Solution
According to a study conducted at a school in Sleman, learning techniques using games have been proven to reduce boredom by about 15 percent. With this learning technique, critical thinking, creativity, innovation, strategy, and problem-solving skills of students can be honed. There are also awards given in games that increase learning motivation and provide instant satisfaction to students. Therefore, we propose a solution in the form of a website with games accompanied by learning modules, namely Kok Tahu. Students can play various games such as quizzes, hangman, crossword puzzles, and musical instrument simulations. If a user successfully reaches a level in the game, they will receive badges that can be collected. However, if a user fails, they can review the material through the provided modules. The creation of a website with educational games will help integrate technology into learning, making students more prepared to face the modern world that is increasingly digital.

### Future Plans
We still plan to connect this application with a back-end system, but it is not feasible due to the limited time. In the future, we will add more game variations so that users do not get bored. We also plan to add a "Teacher" feature so that educational professionals like teachers can customize the questions in the games according to their preferences.

### Conclusion
Developing a website with educational games themed around creative media not only addresses student boredom issues but also opens up new potential in a more inclusive, effective, and enjoyable educational approach.
