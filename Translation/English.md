### Overview
We propose a website with games that include learning modules called Kok Tahu. Students can play various games such as quizzes, musical instrument simulations, etc. If users achieve a certain level in the game, they will receive badges that can be collected. However, if users fail, they can relearn the material through the provided module. The creation of this educational gaming website will help integrate technology into learning, thus preparing students for the modern digital world.

We still plan to connect this application with a back-end system, but it was not feasible due to the limited time. In the future, we intend to add a variety of games so users do not get bored. We also plan to add a ‚ÄúTeacher‚Äù feature so that educators like teachers can customize the game questions according to their preferences.
